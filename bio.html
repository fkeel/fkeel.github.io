<h3>Skills</h3>
<p><strong>Physical Computing</strong><br>
I am fascinated by physical interactive objects. I got involved in Human Computer interaction through interactive robotic art and have since used this fascination to explore diverse topics such as tangible multi-device ecologies, wearables sensors and flexible computers.</p>
<p><strong>Experimental Studies of Human Behavior and Perception</strong><br>
I am interested in how such interactive objects change human perception and behavior. I have therefore set up multiple behavior and psychophysics experiments.</p>
<p><strong>Custom and Novel Sensor Solutions</strong><br>
I think of sensors as a design material, rather than as something used to augment a ‘dumb’ object. I have designed countless custom inertial, infrared, capacitive and resistive sensing solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Soft Circuits &amp;&nbsp;<span>Flexible PCBs</span></strong><br>
My interests in sensor design and wearable computing have led me to investigate how sensors can be integrated into fabric and how fabric itself can be used to create functional electronic textiles. Together with colleagues at the Human Media Lab at Queen’s University I developed my own workflow for designing and manufacturing flexible circuits. By building (and breaking) flexible and elastic circuits, I have an intuitive grasp of their opportunities and constraints.</p>
<p><strong>Haptic Feedback Design</strong><br>
My current research is focused on improving our understanding of haptic perception and learning how to design for it. With my work, I hope to demonstrate how great the untapped potential of this perceptual channel is.</p>
