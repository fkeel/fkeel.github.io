# Developer comment:
#   This is the main file that will contain all research entries.
#   When used, the data from this file is first sorted by year (if present)
#   and then within each year it is shown in order it appears in this file.
#   All entries without the year appear last.
#
#   All images, pdfs and videos were taken from the existing website with their original name.
#   Locally stored files reside in the "/uploads" folder that's split into "image" and "pdf" subfolders for convenience
#   External urls remain the same
#
#   For the time being, it contains just the minimal amount to ensure the functionality.
#   You can start making edits and adding entries as soon as we agree that this data structure makes sense and covers all the needs.


- title: "From Pulse Trains to “Coloring with Vibrations”: Motion Mappings for Mid-Air Haptic Textures"
  year: 2018
  authors: Paul Strohmeier , Sebastian Boring and Kasper Hornbæk
  venue: Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI)
  description: In this paper we explore rendering textures in 3D space. As our feedback system does not provide the counter-force one experiences when interacting with a surface texture, it is not clear how such mid-air textures might be perceived. We present a qualitative analysis of the experience of interacting with mid-air textures, and how input parameters influence this experience.

- title: "zPatch: Hybrid Resistive/Capacitive eTextile Inputs"
  year: 2018
  authors: Paul Strohmeier, Jarrod Knibbe, Sebastian Boring and Kasper Hornbæk
  venue: Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction (TEI)
  description: Touch input on clothing is difficult as there are ample opportunities for unintentional activation. In this paper we present a simple fabric design that acts as both a resistive and a capacitive sensor. We present instructions on how to build it and we demonstrate that the resulting hybrid sensor is more robust than either resistive- or capacitive-only equivalents and that the additional information improves the detection of custom gestures.

- title: "ReFlex: A Flexible Smartphone with Active Haptic Feedback for Bend Input"
  year: 2016
  authors: Paul Strohmeier, Jesse Burstyn, JP Carrascal, Vincent Levesque Roel Vertegaal
  venue: International Conference on Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction (TEI) 2016
  description: We presented the first fully functional, wireless flexible phone. In cooperation with Immersion we augmented the phone with a haptic actuator. This allows us to change how the material properties of the phone are experienced. We conducted studies investigating bend-input mappings to haptic feedback styles.

- title: "What can Doodles on the Arm teach us about On-Body Interaction?"
  year: 2016
  authors: Paul Strohmeier, Juan Pablo Carrascal, Kasper Hornbæk
  venue: Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI EA)
  description: While on-body interaction is treated as a novel concept in HCI, we point out that it is not necessarily the case. One way in which on-body interaction is quite common is the habit of doodling or writing notes on one’s arm. We presented a survey that explores this practice, in hope that it may serve as inspiration for future HCI explorations.

  year: 2017
  authors: Jarrod Knibbe, Paul Strohmeier, Sebastian Boring and Kasper Hornbæk
  venue: Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies (IMWUT)
  description: Using methods presented in this paper we could in the future record the skilled movement of an expert musician and play them back using the hands and fingers of a novice. I assisted in designing the electronics and implemented the circuitry.
