  - title: "From Pulse Trains to “Coloring with Vibrations”: Motion Mappings for Mid-Air Haptic Textures"
    year: 2018
    authors: Paul Strohmeier , Sebastian Boring and Kasper Hornbæk
    venue: Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI)
    description: In this paper we explore rendering textures in 3D space. As our feedback system does not provide the counter-force one experiences when interacting with a surface texture, it is not clear how such mid-air textures might be perceived. We present a qualitative analysis of the experience of interacting with mid-air textures, and how input parameters influence this experience.

  - title: "zPatch: Hybrid Resistive/Capacitive eTextile Inputs"
    year: 2018
    authors: Paul Strohmeier, Jarrod Knibbe, Sebastian Boring and Kasper Hornbæk
    venue: Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction (TEI)
    description: Touch input on clothing is difficult as there are ample opportunities for unintentional activation. In this paper we present a simple fabric design that acts as both a resistive and a capacitive sensor. We present instructions on how to build it and we demonstrate that the resulting hybrid sensor is more robust than either resistive- or capacitive-only equivalents and that the additional information improves the detection of custom gestures.

    year: 2017
    authors: Maurin Donneaud, Cedric Honnet, Paul Strohmeier
    venue: New Instruments for Musical Expression (NIME) 2017
    description: This paper presents a fabric multi-touch sensor that is used as an audio-controller. The sensor was designed by Maurin Donneaud with assistance by Cedric Honnet on the embedded software development. I conducted the evaluation with Cedric and did the analysis as well as the paper write-up.

    year: 2017
    image_outline: true
    authors: Paul Strohmeier, Kasper Hornbæk
    venue: Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI) 2017
    description: When we move our finger over a material, the structure of the fingertip and the structure of the material interact – they generate vibration. These vibrations are experienced as textures. In this paper we explore how properties of such vibrations map to experiences of texture.

    description: Watches became popular because of the fast and intuitive way in which they can be used. Smartwatches typically are more complex, requiring menu navigation or activation gestures. This paper explores a method of adapting a watch face to the users body pose to make interactions with a smartwatch easier.

It is therefore only ‘intuitive’ to people who share his assumptions. We demonstrate how his model would change if the initial assumptions change.

    year: 2016
    authors: Paul Strohmeier, Juan Pablo Carrascal, Kasper Hornbæk
    venue: Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI EA)
    description: While on-body interaction is treated as a novel concept in HCI, we point out that it is not necessarily the case. One way in which on-body interaction is quite common is the habit of doodling or writing notes on one’s arm. We presented a survey that explores this practice, in hope that it may serve as inspiration for future HCI explorations.
