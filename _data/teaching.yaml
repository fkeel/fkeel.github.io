          User Interface Technologies (UIT) is the hardware-focused Master level HCI course offered by the Department of Computer Science. I completely redesigned this course from bottom up. My personal aim of the course was for students to build a physical research prototype, learn how to position their own work relative to current research narratives, and communicate it effectively. In addition to the hardware-prototyping focus of the course, there is a strong emphasis on writing skills. Students work in groups of 3 – 4 on weekly assignments which build upon each other, culminating in a research paper and working demo.

          <a href="http://www.cs.queensu.ca/applicants/coca/">Computing and Creative Arts (COCA201)</a> is the core course of the interdisciplinary Arts &amp; Computer Science Bachelor program of the same name offered at Queen’s University. I taught this course together with Antonio Gomes. We focused on kinetic art &amp; shape changing interfaces. The course is very hands on, the final assignment that each group of 2 – 4 students submits is an interactive art-piece that is publicly exhibited. Two of the groups we taught consequently presented their work at ACE’14

          I taught two three-day workshops for high-school students. The first group of ~20 students was between 15 and 17. They were provided with basic tutorials on electronics and programming with Arduino. Consequently they built their own inventions, for example, gloved-input devices, musical clothing and simple robots.
          The second course was taught to a group of about ~20 students aged 11 to 13. These students also received a basic tutorial on electronics and programming Arduino, but then followed step-by step instructions to build their own light-phobic or light-attracted robot.
          These workshops were both super challenging and super rewarding on many levels – it’s a beautiful experience to see young people learn that they can enjoy learning.

        description: <a href="http://www.lernell.com/">Lernell</a> is a family run toy-design studio that, amongst other customers, designs toys for Disney. If Lernell add interactive features to their toys, these features are usually outsourced to engineering teams. Lernell felt that this process could be improved if they learned to understand interactive electronics better themselves. They hired me for an 8-hour Arduino crash-course.
